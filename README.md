The KazPER ['kæzpə(r)] repository contains a dataset of male and female names common among the Kazakhs.

## name_list.csv

1. Names on the list are in alphabetical order, with one name per line.
2. The Kazakh (e.g., "Айгүл"), Russian (e.g., "Айгуль"), and English (e.g., "Aigul") spellings of a name and the corresponding gender (e.g., "F") are separated by commas.

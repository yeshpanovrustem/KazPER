The KazPER ['kæzpə(r)] repository contains a dataset of male and female names common among the Kazakhs.

## name_list.txt

1. Names on the list are in alphabetical order, with one name per line.
2. The Kazakh spelling of a name (e.g., "Қазыбек") is followed by its Russian spelling (e.g., "Казыбек") and gender (e.g., "M"). The three are separated by a tab.
3. Some names can be both male and female (e.g., "Үміт"). In this case, the names are recorded twice: once as a male name and once as a female name.
4. As of August 5 2022, the total number of names on the list is 5,247, of which 3,738 are male names, 1,509 are female names, and 51 names can be both.

The KazPER ['kæzpə(r)] repository contains a dataset of male and female names common among the Kazakhs.

## name_list.csv

1. Names on the list are in alphabetical order, with one name per line.
2. The Kazakh (e.g., "Айгүл"), Russian (e.g., "Айгуль"), and English (e.g., "Aigul") spellings of a name and the corresponding gender (e.g., "F") are separated by commas.

| kk  | ru | en | gender|
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Айгүл  | Айгуль | Aigul | F |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... |
| Қазыбек  | Казыбек | Kazybek | M |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... |
| Үміт  | Умит | Umit | F |
| Үміт  | Умит | Umit | M |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... |

3. Some names can be both male and female (e.g., "Үміт"). In this case, the names are recorded twice: once as a male name and once as a female name.
4. As of March 15 2023, the total number of names on the list is 5,280, of which 3,772 are male names, 1,508 are female names, and 51 names can be both.
